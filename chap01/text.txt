Image   classification  can perform some pretty amazing feats,
  but    a large drawback of many image classification applications is that
the model can only detect one class per image. With an object detection model,
not only can you   classify multiple classes in one image,
but you can specify exactly where that object is in an image with a bounding box framing the object.
The TensorFlow Models GitHub repository has a large variety of pre-trained
models for   various machine learning tasks, and one excellent resource is
their object detection API. The object detection API makes it extremely
easy to train your own object detection model for a large variety of
different applications. Whether you need a high-speed model to work on live stream
high-frames-per-second applications or high-accuracy desktop models,
the API makes it easy to train and export a model.
